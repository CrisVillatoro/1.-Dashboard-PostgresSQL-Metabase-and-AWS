# Dashboard-PostgresSQL-Metabase-and-AWS

This dashboard summarize the sample Northwind Database; the data is about “Northwind Traders”, a fictional company. The database contains all sales transactions between the company and its customers as well as purchases from Northwinds suppliers. 

A Postgres database was created in order to create tables inside and write SQL queries that retrieves data. SQLAlchemy library was also used ior accessing a database from Python. Ultimately, AWS was used to upload everything into a cloud server and, in this way, building a dashboard with metabase that stayed up and running 24/7.
